# Microcopy Guidelines for Tide UI

## Core Principles

### Use Sentence Case

**Always use sentence case for all UI text**, including buttons, labels, tooltips, error messages, and component text.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Create new account"
- ✅ "Save changes"
- ✅ "Export to CSV"
- ❌ "Create New Account" (title case)
- ❌ "Save Changes" (title case)

**Why sentence case?**
- More conversational and approachable
- Easier to read and scan quickly
- Better accessibility for users with dyslexia
- Cleaner appearance in modern interfaces
- Industry standard (Google, Apple, Microsoft, Material Design)

### Punctuation Rules

**Omit periods after single sentences** in UI elements to reduce visual noise and improve scannability.

**No periods for:**
- Button labels: "Save", "Cancel", "Create account"
- Tooltips: "This action cannot be undone"
- Form labels: "Email address", "Password"
- Modal titles: "Delete account"
- Error messages: "Email is required"
- Helper text: "Must be at least 8 characters"
- Subheadings: "Account settings"

**Use periods when:**
- Multiple complete sentences appear together: "Your changes have been saved. You can now close this window."
- Long descriptive text that forms complete sentences

**Example:**
```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT - Single sentence, no period
<TooltipContent>This action cannot be undone</TooltipContent>

// ✅ CORRECT - Multiple sentences, use periods
<AlertDescription>
  Your account has been created. Please check your email to verify.
</AlertDescription>

// ❌ WRONG - Single sentence with period
<Button>Save changes.</Button>
```

## Exceptions

**Proper nouns and brand names** retain their original capitalization:
- "Sign in with Google"
- "Export to Slack"
- "Connected to GitHub"

## Implementation

When writing Storybook stories, component examples, or default text:
1. Always use sentence case
2. Omit periods for single sentences
3. Keep text concise and scannable
4. Prioritize clarity over cleverness
